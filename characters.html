            <h2 class="title">Madaline</h2>
            <p>Madeline is the main character of Celeste, controlled by the player. She struggles with anxiety and
                depression, which is her reason for climbing Mount Celeste. Madeline can dash, switching her hair color
                from red to white and finally cyan. Her hair also becomes pink, indicating that she can dash twice, at
                the end of Reflection. A hostile Part of Madeline, named Badeline, frequently confronts her during her
                climb.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Badaline</h2>
            <p>Badeline is Madeline's other self. She first appears in Old Site, shattering the mirror. Afterwards, she
                constantly tries to convince Madeline to abandon climbing Celeste Mountain, even causing her to fall at
                the start of Reflection. Following this occasion, Madeline starts fighting Badeline until she finally
                concedes.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Theo</h2>
            <p>Theo is another mountain climber whom Madeline meets in either chapter 1, 2, or 3. He is less serious and
                more laid-back than Madeline. He climbs the mountain mainly to snap some photos for his InstaPix
                profile. Throughout the journey, he also takes a few (two or three depending on the route) selfies with
                Madeline. They help each other on various occasions.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Granny</h2>
            <p>Granny is a character who lived on Celeste Mountain. At first presenting herself as grumpy and
                dismissive, she tried to help Madeline with her climb and gave helpful advice, even supporting Madeline
                after her fall in Reflection and suggesting she find and talk to her other part. Granny died shortly
                before the events of Farewell, which becomes the chapter's key plot point. At the end of said chapter,
                Theo shows Madeline Granny's picture in her youth; there, Granny's name is revealed to be Celia.</p>

            <p>Mr. Oshiro is a ghost who runs Celestial Resort. Throughout this chapter, he accompanies Madeline, trying
                to get her to stay in the hotel. However, after Badeline criticizes him and his resort, he lashes out at
                Madeline, chasing her.</p>

            <p>The Bird is a character that often appears alongside Granny; it is thought that the Bird is
                Granny's pet. It teaches the player the game's controls and techniques. In Farewell, Madeline
                tries to chase the Bird to get to Granny, believing she is near. This causes it to fly away
                until Madeline finally catches it. Later, the Bird becomes an entity flinging Madeline
                rightwards</p>

                Celeste Mountain. Theo mentioned him at the start of Reflection, but his name is only revealed in
                Farewell along with his photo, which Theo shows to Madeline. This photo depicts Carlos with Granny,

                the start of Reflection. Alex will be named Maddy if the player names the main character Alex at the
                beginning of the game. In Celeste 64, it is revealed that Madeline and Alex are dating after being
                hooked up by Theo.</p>
